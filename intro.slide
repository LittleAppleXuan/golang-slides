* What is Go(lang)

- Developed at Google in 2007
- Statically-typed, syntax resembles C
- Garbage collected

* Advantages

- Fast
- Compiles to static binary
- Great standard library
- Promise of backward compatibility (no Py2 -> Py3)
- Concurrent in core (easy and safe)
- Tooling
- Meets nearly all of "Zen of Python" criteria. [[http://talks.golang.org/2012/zen.slide][awesome presentation]]
- *Simple*
- *Explicit*

* Disadvantages

- Young
- Different
- *Simple*
- Requires bit more planning

* Hello world

.play intro/hello_world.go

* Hello world (web)

.play intro/hello_web.go

.link http://localhost:7000 Hello!

* How to use Go

- Go is not Python. To work with Go, forget what you know about Python
- Own idioms, formatting, conventions...
- Philosophy is more important than syntax
- KISS and YAGNI are your best friends (no Django like tools)
- Leverage Go's feature set. Don't try to fight it
- Build smart stuff that is consistent with UNIX philosophy

* Django?

- There is no Django like tool for Go
- There are some more or less feature full frameworks (Martini, Beego, Revel)
- Community do not look for or approve tools that do not use standard Handler and HandlerFunc
- Simple tools over frameworks (net/http, Gorillas, Negroni)

* Tooling

- go build
- go fmt
- go generate
- go get
- go test
- go vet
- godoc
- gorename
- goimports

* Why to use Go

* To create smart tools/apps that make job done.

* Why I'll continue to use Go

- Gives perspective
- Teaches how to create simpler and more maintainable solutions
- Let me build cool tools. Soon native mobile apps too!
- Bottom line: Go makes me a better Python developer, obviously
